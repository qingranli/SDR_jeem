__Fig1_rho_b.m__  generates Figure 1.

__Fig2_rho_t_converging.m__  generates Figure 2 with two values of shadow price of capital `v = 1.44, 2.33`.

__Fig4_and_Fig6.m__  generates Figure 4 and Figure 6. Climate damage estimates for CO2 emission in year 2015 is taken from NAS (2017).

__Fig5_SDR_3cases.m__  generates Figure 5 with selected consumer rate of return `r_c = 2%, 3%, 5%` and the climate damage profiles from NAS (2017).

__Fig7_climate_IAMs.m__  generates Figure 7.

__Table3_compute.m__  computes values in Table 3 given values of consumption rate `r_c` and tax rate `tau`.

__climate_damages_TS.mat__ contains marginal climate damage estimates from three IAMs (DICE, FUND, PAGE) and the one used in NAS (2017).
